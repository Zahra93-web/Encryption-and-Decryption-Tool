Text Encryption and Decryption with File Upload
Project Overview
This web application allows users to encrypt or decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher. The tool can process both manually entered text and text uploaded from a file. It also allows users to specify a shift value for the cipher, enabling encryption and decryption of the file's contents.

Features:
Encrypt and decrypt text via Caesar Cipher.
Upload a text file and process its contents for encryption/decryption.
Specify a shift value for the cipher to control the encryption level.
Display the result of the encryption or decryption in a text area.
Technologies Used
HTML: Structure of the web page.
CSS: Styling for the layout and design.
JavaScript: Logic for handling encryption, decryption, file reading, and user interaction.
How to Use
Manually Enter Text:

Type the text you want to encrypt or decrypt in the text area labeled "Enter your message".
Enter a shift value for the Caesar Cipher in the input box.
Click the "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" button to see the result in the output area.
Upload a Text File:

Click the "Or upload a text file" button to choose a .txt file from your computer.
Enter a shift value for the cipher.
Click the "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" button to process the file's content and display the result.
View Results:

The encrypted or decrypted content will appear in the result text area.
How the Application Works
Caesar Cipher:

The application uses a basic Caesar Cipher to encrypt and decrypt text. This cipher works by shifting each letter in the alphabet by a specified number (the shift value).
For example, a shift of 3 would turn the letter 'A' into 'D', 'B' into 'E', and so on.
File Handling:

The app can process text files uploaded by the user. When a file is uploaded, its content is read using the FileReader API, and the text is then encrypted or decrypted based on the shift value.
Encryption/Decryption Logic:

The JavaScript functions for encryption and decryption loop through the text, shifting each letter by the specified amount. Non-alphabetical characters (like spaces or punctuation) remain unchanged.
File Structure
bash
Copy code
/index.html          # HTML file for the structure
/style.css           # CSS file for styling
/script.js           # JavaScript file for logic
/README.md           # Project documentation
To Run Locally
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/encryption-decryption-tool.git
Navigate to the project folder:

bash
Copy code
cd encryption-decryption-tool
Open index.html in your browser to use the application.

Enhancements (Optional)
Support for Additional File Types: Currently, the tool only supports .txt files, but you can modify the app to process other file types (e.g., .json or .csv).
File Download Feature: Allow users to download the encrypted or decrypted text as a new file.
Improved Error Handling: Handle errors more gracefully, especially when reading files that don't meet expectations.
